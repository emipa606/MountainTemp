Just below the surface of the planet, the rock is a fairly stable temperature. 

This mod stabilizes rooms with any portion of a natural roof to either the seasonal average, annual average or a fixed point temperature (configurable in the settings). 
The more and thicker the natural roof, the more it will move towards this temperature. 
Extreme temperatures can still effect rooms deep underground through the passage ways leading to them so don't expect a constant temperature all the time.</description>
